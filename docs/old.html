  <p><strong>Thoughtful Biometrics Workshop</strong> is a space to dialogue about critical emerging issues surrounding biometric and digital identity technologies.</p>

<h3 id="this-is-a-4-day-virtual-event-11-13-15-and-20-july-2022">This is a 4 day virtual event. 11, 13, 15, and 20 July 2022.</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em>Please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe6lrXPP7f1tMvFVSo3dyFp7wLt18QEvkeTopNVGvbuk3eApw/viewform?usp=sf_link">fill out this form</a> to be updated when registration opens.</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Biometrics technologies are used in many contexts and there are many questions about their ethical and socially good uses.</p>

<h2 id="invitation-or-why-we-need-this-event">Invitation <em>or</em> why we need this event:</h2>

<p>Shouting <em>“Biometrics solve X brilliantly!”</em> or <em>“Biometrics threaten Y horribly!”</em> is so pre-corona. We need a middle way and place for responsible and thoughtful folks to explore hopeful paths.</p>

<h3 id="questions-include">Questions include:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>How do they work?</li>
  <li>How are they being used?</li>
  <li>What are the dangers of their use?</li>
  <li>What are appropriate and good uses?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="our-society-is-complex">Our society is complex.</h2>

<p>The systems within it are complex and built by networks of professionals each with their own deep technical expertise.</p>

<p>One of the challenges we face now is that these professionals are so deep in their own fields they rarely talk to those in neighboring communities who are technologies all come together in these systems.</p>

<p>We note that there are discussions happening between these professionals but usually within companies and small groups bubbles that have never been open or include more individuals in an open and transparent discussion.</p>

<p><strong>Our hope is this event creates more cross-pollination and exploration of the technologies along with the social and policy implications of them</strong>. We invite discussion about tangible risks/threat models and all levels from the micro to the macro systems.</p>

<h3 id="we-want-to-expand-the-conversation-inclusive-to-support-hearing-the-voices-at-the-edges">We want to expand the conversation, inclusive to support “hearing” the voices at the edges.</h3>

<p>We welcome the participation of people who ask serious questions about these systems.</p>

<p>We also want to invite those active in the industry who want to respond in a meaningful way to thoughtful criticism.</p>

<p><em>This workshop is not to “sell” biometrics products like the Connect:ID Conference or K(n)ow Identity Conference by OWI.</em></p>

<h2 id="we-have-several-starting-axioms-for-this-event">We have several starting axioms for this event:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Biometrics are a technology that is being used and will not be vanishing.</li>
  <li>There are a range of uses for these technologies that can be good and can be bad.</li>
  <li>We value discernment about the application of biometrics technology.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our vision for the convene a range of constituencies whose work touches on biometrics and use in the real world.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Biometrics Community</li>
  <li>Researchers and scientist  who is looking for new ideas to work on</li>
  <li>Identity Community</li>
  <li>Commercial Users of systems</li>
  <li>Regulators and policy makers</li>
  <li>Cybersecurity Professionals</li>
  <li>Privacy Professionals</li>
  <li>Humanitarian Groups</li>
  <li>Police Accountability Groups</li>
  <li>Citizen Watchdog Groups</li>
  <li>Students and Researchers</li>
</ul>

<p>We hope that the conversations catalyzed at the event are starting points for ongoing work in fora that touch on biometrics issues.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-format">About the Format</h2>

<p>Our inspiration for this event comes from the <a href="http://www.internetidentityworkshop.com">Internet Identity Workshop</a> an event uses the open space technology to co-create the agenda live the day of the event. There are no keynotes or panels, it’s all about exploring the topic with professional peers from a range of industries. We are curating videos that people who are attending can watch ahead of time to get up to speed about some of the technologies and topics of interest but the format at the event is discussion driven and about peer learning. We do know great people who will be there and it is the attendees who have a passion for learning and contributing to the event that make it the success it is.</p>

<h2 id="the-conveners">The Conveners</h2>

<p><em>The Conveners List is being formed Still</em></p>

<h2 id="image-commentary">Image Commentary</h2>

<center><img width="10%" src="/assets/Biometric.jpg" alt="Biometric man by Welleman" /><br /><sup><em><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Biometric.jpg">CC by 3.0</a></em></sup></center>

<p>This image reflects a range of different biometrics modalities.</p>

<p>We note that the subject in the image is a white male and this reflects one of the questions about the industry, is it true that biometrics systems are built based on a default human “the white guy”? Does this mean that women and people of color are not included, or biometric systems are inherently biased? We also note that there is a law enforcement person who is watching and accessing the data invading the privacy of the individual.</p>

<p>We like the image because it highlights the growing concerns about biometric function creep where biometric data can be shared and misused without users’ knowledge via these interconnected biometric systems.</p>

<h2 id="logistics">Logistics</h2>

<p>This is a 4 day virtual virtual event.</p>

<p>It is on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and the following Wednesday - 11, 13, 15, and 20 July 2022.
Each day will begin at 9am PST to 1pm PST / Noon EST to 5 EST.</p>

<p>We are looking for sponsors who want to support this kind of dialogue.
We will be hosting it virtually on the same platform that IIW uses - QiQoChat.</p>
