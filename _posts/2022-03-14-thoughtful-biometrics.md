# Invitation

The Thoughtful Biometrics Workshops create a space to dialogue about critical emerging issues surrounding biometric and digital identity technologies.

We welcome the participation of *people who ask serious questions* about these systems.

We invite those active in the industry who want to *respond in a meaningful way* to thoughtful criticism.

*This workshop is not to “sell” biometrics products like trade shows. We explore this problem space and seek a path forward.*

## Your Concerns

Biometrics are widely used and there are many questions about their ethical and socially good uses.

Questions include:

* How do they work?
* How are they being used?
* What are the dangers of their use?
* What are the appropriate and even good uses?

## Context and Challenges

[The problem](#silos), [Our response](#our-response), [Our assumptions](#axioms), [Who we need in this conversation](#you-should-be-here-if-you)
and [our conveners' invitations to you](#conveners).

<a name="silos"></a>

**Silos.**

Networks of professionals build systems, each network with their own deep technical expertise. These professionals are so deep in their own fields they rarely talk to those in neighboring communities.

Discussions happen between these professionals but usually within companies or small groups.

These isolated conversations have never been open or transparent. Until this Workshop.

## Our Response

* The Workshop fosters more cross-pollination and exploration of the technologies. And maps to their social and policy implications. We invite discussion about tangible risks and threat models at all levels, from the micro to the macro systems.
* We want to expand the conversation to support “hearing” the voices at the edges.
* We welcome people who ask serious questions about these systems.
* This workshop is not to “sell” biometrics products like industry trade shows and conferences.

## Axioms

* Biometrics technologies are in widespread use and will not vanish.
* Their uses can be good or can be bad.
* We value discernment about the application of biometrics technology.

<a name="you-should-be-here-if-you"></a>
## You should be here if you…

* You should be here if your work touches on biometrics and its use in the real world.
* You should be here if you have a bias for action.

Come if you want Workshop conversations to start ongoing work on biometrics issues.

## Conveners

We invited experts from diverse fields to tell us why this conversation matters now. [A biometric scientist](#biometric-scientist-asem-othman), [a biometric service CEO](#software-architect-and-developer-jack-john-callahan), [a privacy commissioner](#privacy-commissioner-brian-hofer), and [an identity expert](#digital-identity-expert-kaliya-young-identity-woman).  

<a name="asemothman"></a>

### Biometric scientist Asem Othman
<img src="/assets/bios/asem.jpg" style="border:1px #000; float:left; padding: 1em; border-radius:50%;">
> “As a biometric and document verification researcher and developer, I was attending three types of events.
>
> Biometric conferences that are merely focused on the state-of-the-art research. Where biometric academic researchers are looking to advance biometric systems (e.g., improving the accuracy, acquisition, template extraction, template storage, etc.).
>
> Then there are identity conferences and workshops such as IIW, where different identity ecosystems and architectures are discussed, and I always have this question: how come they discuss identity without consulting the most reliable way to do it? Biometric is the only way to prove who you are!! I am obviously biased.
>
> Then there are these biometric and identity shows that are mainly vendor-driven industrial marketing and product showcases. In this aforementioned category of the conference, participants of these shows are conservative in sharing ideas. They are by and large “selling” biometric/identity systems to governments and enterprises that buy them at scale.
>
> Therefore, I believe this workshop will bring developers, researchers, and thought leaders from these two interconnected communities to openly share ideas and be transparent about their concerns and issues about the other side.
>
> Based on my interaction with both communities, I believe these concerns are merely due to misunderstanding about the basics; from one side, about biometric and the current state of the art research in the biometric space, and on the other side, the recent fast-paced development and improvement that is happening in the different identity ecosystems. Once this misunderstanding is cleared out, and knowledge transfer occurs, this workshop will create neat and doable ideas that will advance the biometric and identity development into a new and remarkable era.”

***Dr. Asem Othman*** ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/asemothman/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/asem_othman)) *has more than ten years as a researcher, developer and leader in the biometrics space. During his doctoral research at West Virginia University, he developed a system of protecting and storing biometric templates using visual cryptography, which Veridium uses today in its VeridiumID solution. Dr. Othman performed his postdoctoral research at Michigan State University before joining the Computer Vision team at Veridium and leading research and development on their 4 Fingers TouchlessID technology. Dr. Othman holds more than 5 patents/patents pending and has published a variety of journal articles, conference papers, and key research entries. In February 2021, Dr. Othman joined [Acuant](https://www.acuant.com/), a document verification leader, as a Director of Computer Vision and Machine Learning.*

### Software architect and developer Jack “John Callahan”
<img src="/assets/bios/jack.jpg" style="border:1px #000; float:left; padding: 1em; border-radius:50%;">
> “Biometrics are more relevant than ever because of the increase in remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Protection and control (by each person) of their biometric data is paramount to assure that privacy, accessibility, inclusion, and diversity are available to all.”

***Dr. John Callahan*** ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-callahan-430707/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/johnrcallahan)) *is responsible for the development of VeridiumID’s world class enterprise-ready biometric solutions, leading a global team of software developers, computer vision scientists and sales engineers. He has previously served as the Associate Director for Information Dominance at the U.S. Navy’s Office of Naval Research Global, London UK office, via an Intergovernmental Personnel Act assignment from the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. John completed his PhD in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park.*

### Privacy commissioner Brian Hofer
<img src="/assets/bios/brian.jpg" style="border:1px #000; float:left; padding: 1em; border-radius:50%;">
> “The use of biometric technology in our everyday lives is not yet a foregone conclusion. Although biometrics suggests an exciting promise of perfect security and convenience, the potential pitfalls from identity theft, unregulated data brokers, and government overreach are equally significant. Far too often the tech sector rushes to market without first creating sufficient guardrails to mitigate the potential negative impacts from newer and more powerful technology. New and emerging technologies must first be understood before possible implementation and use.”

***Brian Hofer*** *is Chair of the [Oakland Privacy Advisory Commission](https://www.oaklandca.gov/boards-commissions/privacy-advisory-board) and the Chair and Executive Director of [Secure Justice](https://secure-justice.org/). His advocacy has been instrumental in a number of nation-leading ordinances, including ones that established a vetting framework for the potential acquisition and use of surveillance equipment. Mr. Hofer is presently consulting with the cities of San Diego, San Jose, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C. and Portland on establishing similar frameworks. <br/><br/>Brian has presented on his work at conferences sponsored by the California Department of Justice, National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, Berkeley Law School, NYU Law School, Georgetown Law School, Berkeley Goldman School of Public Policy, and he has testified before various California state Senate and Assembly committees in support of privacy enhancing legislation.*

### Digital identity expert Kaliya Young “Identity Woman”
<img src="/assets/bios/kaliya2.jpg" style="border:1px #000; float:left; padding: 1em; border-radius:50%;">
> “Digital Identity experts are not biometrics experts. The role that biometrics can play in digital identity systems is varied. I had a lot of preconceived notions about biometrics before I learned more about how they actually worked and how they fit within systems. It has been eye opening to engage with Jack and Asem and my hope is that other identity experts will find value in engaging with biometric experts.

> Biometrics have a great potential to be quite dangerous if abused. The ethical side of the industry see they have great potential to address some use-cases (such as recovery) that otherwise would be very difficult.”

***Kaliya Young*** *(formerly Hamlin) is an expert in self-sovereign identity and identity on the blockchain. She is the co-author of [A Comprehensive guide to Self-Sovereign Identity](https://www.amazon.com/Comprehensive-Guide-Self-Sovereign-Identity-ebook/dp/B07Q3TXLDP/) and is widely known as Identity Woman (it’s also the name of [her blog](https://identitywoman.net/blog-2/) and [her twitter handle](https://twitter.com/identitywoman)). She has committed her life to the development of an open-standards based layer of the Internet that empowers people.*

# Format

This is a four-day virtual workshop.

* Monday, Wednesday and Friday - 11, 13, 15, 20 July 2022
* Wednesday, 20 July 2022: A *Day Of Action.*
* 9am to 2pm Pacific / Noon to 5pm Eastern / 5pm to 10pm London

## It’s a proven format.

Ever “sign in with X”? OAuth and other identity technologies came from the *Internet Identity Workshop*. We developed this format over thirty *IIW*s, where attendees co-create the agenda live, each day. There are no keynotes or panels; it’s about exploring the topic with professional peers from a range of industries.

The Workshop is discussion driven and about peer learning and co-creating. Great people will be there. Attendees with passion for learning, and for contributing to the event, make it successful.

## How an Unconference Works

1. **Host Committee writes invitation** so…
2. The right participants register and the…
3. **Attendees co-create The Agenda each morning** at which…
4. **Attendees lead sessions** where…
5. Participants write notes for a Book of Proceedings.
6. Attendees recap their takeaways at the all-hands closing circle so…
7. **Community emerges**.

## Day One - Level Setting

Our first day of TBW2 is in the World Café format. We break into small groups for discussion among strangers.

### Open Introductions

* Who am I
* Where am I coming from
* What I want to share or learn from this

### World Café for Level Setting

* Explain World Café
* Organizers set the stage with a question for the tables.
* Each café table is a small group conversation.
* At the end of a round, one person stays, the rest go to other tables.
* Repeat for three rounds

### Harvesting The Day

* Ask the whole room to give feedback. Post-it wall. Gisting of what you learned.
* Name potential topics for the Day Two/Three parking lot.
* Look at clusters and themes rising from this.

## Days Two and Three – Open Space

We’ll switch to the Open Space Technology format for the rest of the Workshop. It was innovated over thirty years to support “alive” conversations that inspire thought and action.

### Opening Circle

Participants gather in the “main room” video chat where attendees can name a topic they would like to discuss, a presentation they would like to share, or a question they would see answers to. These session conveners pick a time and space on our “agenda wall” for that session to happen. Together, just in time, those in the room create the most relevant agenda on that day.

### Sessions

There will be three one-hour time slots each day, with a 15 min break in between them. Participants facilitate their sessions. We follow the four Open Space principles:

* Whoever comes to a session are the right people.
* Whenever it starts is the right time.
* Whatever happens is the only thing that could have.
* When it’s over, it’s over.

Follow the “Law of Two Feet”. Do you find yourself in a session but not learning or contributing? Find another session where you can.

### Document

Leave footprints. During your sessions, we encourage group editing of a session google doc to document your session. The doc is for the public Workshop proceedings.

### Closing Circle

We wrap up each day by recapping each session, so we get a sense of what we missed. We call out observations and insights, remaining concerns and future work. We thank the people who inspired us that day.

## Day Four - A Day Of Action

Workshoppers choose next steps. Turn ideas into schedules, goals, calls. Choose channels, form teams, find allies. 

<a name="team"></a>
## A proven team.

### Building on last year’s successes:

Positive and effective space:

* Proven unconference interactions.

# Conduct

Thoughtful Biometrics Workshop Code of Conduct:

* We want to expand the conversation, and be inclusive to support “hearing” the voices at the edges.
* We welcome the participation of people who ask serious questions about these systems.
* We have invited those active in the industry who want to exchange ideas and respond in a meaningful way to thoughtful critique and criticism.

**Engagement Guidelines**

We create, together as participants, the environment that we all inhabit over the three days of the *Thoughtful Biometrics Workshop.* As such we each are responsible for contributing to a safe space for respectful and meaningful conversations and exchange over the course of the event.

We expect everyone attending to conduct themselves at all times during the workshop in a respectful, professional and decent manner. No space can be completely “safe” and we agree to work together to maintain a productive, enjoyable and open space for everyone.

To be very explicit about Expected Behavior and Unacceptable Behavior, we like how the W3C outlined these in their Positive Work Environment Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct. We will use their descriptions to help us address any issues. [https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/cepc/)

**We’re here to help.**

If you encounter any behavior that causes you any concern, please bring it immediately to the attention of the event staff.
